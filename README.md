# mars-weather-web scrape

This is the Module 11 Challenge for the Rice University Data Analytics & Visualization bootcamp. In this challenge, we used our html reading and parsing knowledge to examine two websites, each containing information about the planet Mars.

In part one of this challenge, we visited a website containing news headlines and articles about Mars, and used BeautifulSoup to scan the website to store the website's headlines and article snippets in a dictionary for easy reference.

In part two, we used a website that contained a table of Mars' meteorological data collected by NASA's Curiosity rover over a period of five years. We once again used BeautifulSoup to scan the website and collect the data, then stored it in a dataframe. We then analyzed the data using Pandas and stored it in a csv file.

This code was written in VS Code's Jupyter notebooks. For best results, use VS Code or a Jupyter Notebooks web browser to run the code. If there are issues in the code, feel free to get in touch to let me know.

The code contained in this repository is my work and mine alone. I received input and advice from Rice University's instructors and tutors, but the work itself is all mine.

Thank you!
